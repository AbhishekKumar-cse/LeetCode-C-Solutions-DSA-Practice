## 🧩 Sample Code Snippet

```cpp
//https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number/

#include<iostream>
#include<vector>
using namespace std;

int singleNumber(vector<int>&nums){
    int ans=0;
    for(int i=0; i<nums.size(); i++){
        ans^= nums[i];// Using XOR operation to find the single number
    }
    return ans;
}
int main(){
    vector<int> nums = {4, 1, 2, 1, 2};
    cout << "The single number is: " << singleNumber(nums) << endl; // Output should be 4
    return 0;
}
